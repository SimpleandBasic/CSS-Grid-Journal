          <h2>  <p>This Website is a dedicated Web Development Journal.</p></h2>

          <p>-The idea is that I will be able to log my progress everyday.
            It would be really cool the website itself look similar to xanga!
          <br>-Perhaps, this website could end up also being a portfolio, or the beginning of a portoflio
          <br>-Turn this into a place, I can click on and begin writing a new journal entry</p>

          <h3><i>Start working on grids</i> </h3>
          <p>
          It would be cool if everytime I wanted to access this blog, I need to have a password.
          It would also be cool if If everytime I needed it to remember me It would. So there would
          be a sign on Screen

          <br>- having a margin and some padding would make this site look better as well

              I would like to change up the fonts a little bit.
              It would also be pretty cool to have A banner Up Top .
              Google Fonts is going to be something i need to work with.

            <p>
              It would be cool to add a circle profile picture
              <br>It would be cool to have a banner as well,
               with a simple piece of black and white art (like a scrible, maybe even
               a signature similar to that of Drew)
